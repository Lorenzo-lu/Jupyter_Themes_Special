# Jupyter Themes

This project provides some special jupyter themes. You can:

* download this repo
* open the <b>console</b> folder and open <b>console.py</b>
*  ```PATH``` is the pathname from step 2 (if the automatic process just works, just skip it), ```code_size``` modifies how large your codes and outputs are, ```code_inline_height``` modifies your codes inline height. ```markdown_size``` and ```markdown_line_height``` do the same operations to markdowns; 
* Run in terminal ```bash console.sh```. If you don't want to lose your previous style, move your original 'custom' folder from '.jupyter' to somewhere else in advance!
* If you see `No such file or directory:...`, run `jupyter-notebook --generate-config` and redo the last step;
* Enjoy it!
